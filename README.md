# WaterDistributionSystemLoopMethod

Modelling and Simulation of Water Networks based on Least Square Loop Flows State Estimator 

This Matlab software implements the Least Squares state estimator described in the below papers and which state estimator is based on the loop corrective flows and the variation of nodal demands as independent variables.
